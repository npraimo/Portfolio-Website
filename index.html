      Currently, I'm coding in CSS, HTML, Javascript, and I have a desire to
      learn Node.js, Python, and React. I'm seeking junior opportunities, full
      stack or front-end, to learn and grow. <br />
      My background is in finance and economics, specifically defined
      contribution investments; however, I am passionate about problem solving
      through creativity, design, and research.
